# MTA-Data_Structure_Course-ProgEx01

Project summary: 
The program receives non-negative n  integer and 2 n-digits numbers x and y.
The program multiplies x and y and calculates the result in 3 ways:
(1) Long multiplication
(2) Karatsub'a algorithm (Recursive)
(3) Karatsub'a algorithm (Iterative)

Comments + project-assumption:
(1) The printed-output should not contain leading zeros. However, the result-vector of each algorithm can contain leading zeros.
(2) Can use only with <iostream>, <vector>, <string> libraries.
(5) Each given factor would be a n-digit number and could be bigger than int, long int, etc.
